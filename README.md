# Voice-based-Email-System-for-the-visually-impaired


## ABSTRACT : 
<p align="justify">One of the most used forms of communication among people is Email. A lot of confidential and urgent information is exchanged over emails in todayâ€™s time. There are about 253 million visually impaired people worldwide. These visually impaired people are facing a problem of communication. Since technology is growing day by day, these visually challenged people feel that they are more challenged.</p>

<p align="justify">
So, we proposed a Voice-based Email System using AI that will make the email system very easily accessible to visually challenged people and also help society. Accessibility is the most important feature that is considered while developing this system. </p><br/>

Visual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses.

Although there are many screen readers available then also these people face some minor difficulties.

We have come up with this project in which we will be developing a voice based email system which will aid the visually impaired people who are naive to computer systems to use email facilities in a hassle free manner.

We use:

STT (Speech-to-text): here whatever we speak is converted to text.
Text to speech synthesizer which converts the text format of the emails to synthesized speech.
IVR (Interactive voice response): allows user to interact with an email host system via voice request, after that users can easily service their own enquiries by listening to the IVR dialogue.
When using this system the computer will be prompting the user to perform specific operations to avail respective services.
